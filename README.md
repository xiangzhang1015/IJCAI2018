This is the Python code for the paper 'Multi-modality Sensor Data Classification with Selective Attention' which is accepted by IJCAI 2018. The paper can be found at https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/432, https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/0432.pdf

Python 2.7
TensorFlow 1.0

The env_spatial_hmm.py, RL_brain.py, and run_this.py are the reinforcement learning environment, client, and main codes. The RNN_attentionbar.py is the proposed WAS-LSTM classifier. More details are explained in the codes.
